# AuctionHandler
Source code of Auction Handler Bot.

This Discord Bot is used by thousands of members in a community I cherish. It serves as an addition to an already existing bot used by a community totaling over 500 thousand players.
This purpose of this program is to support the current hard-working handlers as well as adding a couple quality of life and fun features for the community.

Functions:
1. Private: automatic timer that serves to ping specific auction handlers when an auction ends.
2. Private: !timers command which is used to display the current auction channels that are done/ongoing.
3. Private: Pings contracted auction handlers when current handler is next in queue for auction.
4. Public: !auction command which is used to display current ongoing auctions and the item that is auctioned.
5. Public: !lb command which is used to display a leaderboards consisting the top 50 players who won the most bids.

Keep in mind that this program will not operate without filling in blank channel and user IDs, and a private Google Spreadsheet key. Additionally, multiple dependencies are required, such as npm node and npm google-spreadsheet. Please contact andrewvcle@icloud.com or aguaseous on Discord for additional information.
